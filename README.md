# Hospital System Application Code
This code is used as a way to gather information to place in a hospital system database (database not included).

## Description
This project is a program that collects information about patients when they are first admitted to the hospital as a user-friendly way to get the information into the hospital system's database. You simply type in the prompted information for the patient. Once you finish putting in all the information, you can review the patient's information before saving it to the database.
